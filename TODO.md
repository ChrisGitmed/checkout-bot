# TODO
1. Create a simple web server using Node.js and Express.js.
2. Create and connect a simple PostgreSQL database.
3. Write a function which sends a request to a specific store's/company's API.
4. Update the function to check for a specific SKU (is there a better way?)
5. Set up cron actions to run every minute (or 5 minutes? or 1 hour?)
6. Update the cron action to use the newly created function.
7. Determine a spending limit so we don't blow all our money immediately.
8. Set up purchasing of them item (need to figure out how to do this).
9. Set up SMS/RCS alerts that an item has been found and/or purchased (optional: do we want to manually confirm purchases once the items are in our cart? If the items are not going to go out of stock once they're in our cart, then yes, else probably not).
10. Build comprehensive local tests.
11. Deploy AWS infrastructure.
